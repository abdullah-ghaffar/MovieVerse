## ðŸ”‘ API

This project uses the [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

### How to Add Your API Key
To run the app, you need your own free API key from the TMDb website.

1.  Get your API key from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
2.  Open the `MovieViewModel.kt` file.
3.  Find all the places that say `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` and replace it with your actual key.
    *(Note: For a real production app, this key would be stored securely in a `local.properties` file, not directly in the code.)*
